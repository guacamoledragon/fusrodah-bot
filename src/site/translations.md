# Translations
[pawa](https://pawa.im) supports "speaking" in the following languages:

| Language            | Code    | Status     | Contributors  |
|---------------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| English             | `en`    | Done       |               |
| Portuguese (Brazil) | `pt_BR` | Incomplete | Zeus Portella |


## Contribute
We need your help! [pawa](https://pawa.im) will only be able to speak other languages if contributed by the community.

- Do **NOT** remove `%s`, these are placeholders
- You can submit partial translations, [pawa](https://pawa.im) will fallback to English

### Properties File

Download the [`translations.properties`](https://gitlab.com/pawabot/pawa/-/blob/master/src/main/resources/translations.properties) and translate each of the sentences. You can either, submit a Merge Request directly to the GitLab repository naming your file `translations_<lang>.properties` OR DM the file on Discord.

### POEditor

Go to [pawa's POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=qQs2GuUoYv) project page, and add a language. The translations will be synchronized on the next release.
